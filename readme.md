# Neural Network Training 

Neural Networks (NN) are computing models designed to find underlying relationships within the data that is fed to the model. Its name comes from the resemblance with the human brain and how brain cells are interconnected.

Most of the models written here come from the TensorFlow Developer Certification Course available in Udemy

## File List:
### NN_Classif 
+ save_model_Non_Linear: This folder contains a trained non-linear classification model

+ NN_1.py: This file contains 7 different models that aim to demonstrate how a model behaves when a hyperparameter is changed
 
+ activation_functions.py This file demonstrates how the train data is changed when an activation function is added to a layer.
 
+ learning_rate.py This file shows how to insert a callback in the model to change a parameter while training the model.

+ load_non_linear.py: This file loads a pre-trained model, inputs a random dataset created in Excel and plots how are the predictions with the real life dataset.

+ more_classif_methods.py: This file shows how to create a confusion matrix.
