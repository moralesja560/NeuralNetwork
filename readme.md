# Neural Network Training 

Neural Networks (NN) are computing models designed to find underlying relationships within the data that is fed to the model. Its name comes from the resemblance with the human brain and how neurons are deeply interconnected.

Most of the models written here come from the TensorFlow Developer Certification Course available in Udemy

## File List:
### NN_Classif 
+ save_model_Non_Linear: This folder contains a trained non-linear classification model

+ NN_1.py: This file contains 7 different models that aim to demonstrate how a model behaves when a hyperparameter is changed
 
+ activation_functions.py This file demonstrates how the train data is changed when an activation function is added to a layer.
 
+ learning_rate.py This file shows how to insert a callback in the model to change a parameter while training the model.

+ load_non_linear.py: This file loads a pre-trained model, inputs a random dataset created in Excel and plots how are the predictions with the real life dataset.

+ more_classif_methods.py: This file shows how to create a confusion matrix.

### NN_Linear
+ MSE vs MAE.py:A file to compare the same model but with different loss function Mean Average Error and Mean Squared Error

+ Training 1/2/3 : Three linear regression models

+ Loading_neural_model1/2/3: Three files that load pre-trained models
   + Folders for these pre-trained model are in the main directory

+ multi-var_NN.py: A linear regression model with many independent variables.

+ Norm_Stand.py: A file to demonstrate how to normalize and standardize data.

### Resources

+ data.csv : A simple dataset to test linear regression
+ data_model7.csv: This is the Excel file that contains the non-linear random data for the model to predict from.
+ insurance.csv: This file is used in the Multivar_NN.py
