Architecture of a classification model

		Hyperparameter		|	Binary classification  		|   Multi-class classification

Input layer shape			|	Same as # of features		|	Same as Binary 	
Hidden layer				|	Problem specific			|	Same as Binary
Neurons per hidden layer	|	Problem specific			|	Same as Binary
Output layer shape			|	1 (One class or the other)	|	1 per class
Hidden activation			|	Usually ReLU				|	Same as Binary
Output activation			|	Sigmoid						|	Softmax
Loss function				|	Cross Entropy				|	CategoricalCrossEntropy
Optimizer					|	SGD or Adam					|	Same as Binary classification
