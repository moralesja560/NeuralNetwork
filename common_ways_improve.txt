Common ways to improve a deep model

Adding layers
increase the number of hidden units
change the activation functions
change the optimization functions
change the learning rate
fitting on more data
fitting for longer


Non-Linearity: The missing piece
		For non Linearity please use whatever activation function is available but linear.
		also, please use "sigmoid" activation in the 1 neuron output layer.
		Please notice that the output layer needs to contain 1 hidden neuron only. This is to signal the model that we expect single item output

	
The combination of linear and non-linear functions is one the key fundamentals of neural networks.
