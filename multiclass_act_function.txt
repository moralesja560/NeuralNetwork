Architecture of a classification model

		Hyperparameter		|	Binary classification  		|   Multi-class classification		| CNN

Input layer shape			|	Same as # of features		|	Same as Binary 					| [batch size,height,width,channel]
Hidden layer				|	Problem specific			|	Same as Binary					| Not Especified
Neurons per hidden layer	|	Problem specific			|	Same as Binary					| Not Especified
Output layer shape			|	1 (One class or the other)	|	1 per class						| 1 per class
Hidden activation			|	Usually ReLU				|	Same as Binary					| Usually ReLU
Output activation			|	Sigmoid						|	Softmax							| Depends if binary o multiclass
Loss function				|	Cross Entropy				|	CategoricalCrossEntropy			| Depends
Optimizer					|	SGD or Adam					|	Same as Binary classification	| Same
Convolutional layer																				| Keras.Layers.ConvxD
Pooling Layer																					| AvgPool2D or MaxPool2D
